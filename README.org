This is my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration file. It is updated regularly. I use emacs for all my
[[https://www.colinmclear.net/posts/texteditor/][academic work]]. The configuration tends in that direction. It also uses [[http://www.vim.org][vim]]
keybindings. I used vim (or [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]) previously. I think vim's modal editing is the
best way to use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][text-editor]]. If you like vim bindings but don't tend to want to
think about configuring emacs, I strongly recommend [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]] or [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]] as a way
of managing your configuration. For a more traditional emacs feel there are also the
configurations of [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][purcell]] and [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][batsov (prelude)]] and [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][many others]]. For a minimally sane
setup you might also look at some [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][sensible defaults]]. This file is also influenced by
the [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/bmacs][bmacs]] configuration of Bryan Gilbert (see also his [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter][literate starter kit]]) and [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs][Karl
Voit's]] config. Some other good emacs starter kits to look at include John Kitchen's
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][scimax]] and Kieran Healy's [[https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit][social sciences starter kit]].

This config is based on a series of "[[file:setup-config/][modules]]" loaded in the [[file:init.el][init.el]] file. Please see
that file and the various config "[[file:init.el::;;;%20Config%20Helper%20Functions][helper]]" functions for navigation. Note that I also
have an [[file:early-init.el][early-init]] file for use with emacs 27. 

General features of this emacs setup include:

1. Comprehensive [[file:setup-config/setup-keybindings.el][keybindings]] using spacebar as my leader key
2. [[file:setup-config/setup-evil.el][Evil mode]]
3. Sensible [[file:setup-config/setup-settings.el][defaults]]
4. [[file:setup-config/setup-dired.el][Dired]] with good colors and evil keybindings
5. Completion with [[file:setup-config/setup-helm.el][helm]] and [[file:setup-config/setup-ivy.el][ivy]] (helm-centric though)
6. Custom [[file:setup-config/setup-theme.el][solarized]] theme (mac-centric with toggles for dark/light mode)
7. A nice [[file:setup-config/setup-modeline.el][modeline]] (based on [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][Doom modeline]])
8. Extensive [[file:setup-config/setup-osx.el][OSX integration]]
9. Single frame [[file:setup-config/setup-projects.el][project]] workflow with [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]], and [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspectives]]
10. A nice [[file:setup-config/setup-dashboard.el][dashboard]] homescreen
11. A [[file:setup-config/setup-writing.el][writing-centric]] config with markdown, [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]], [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft][zettel notes]], and [[file:setup-config/setup-org.el][org-mode]]
