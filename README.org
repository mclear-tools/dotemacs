These are my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration files. I use them with MacOS and either
[[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] or [[https://github.com/daviderestivo/homebrew-emacs-head][emacs-head]], and built via [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]. Right now I'm using this recipe:

#+begin_src sh
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-no-frame-refocus --with-xwidgets --with-native-comp --with-modern-black-variant-icon
#+end_src

The config files are updated/tweaked regularly. I use emacs primarily for all my
academic work in the humanities (for discussion of my view of text editors [[https://www.colinmclear.net/posts/texteditor/][see here]])
and the style of configuration tends in that direction (rather than opposed to, e.g.,
a programming language emphasis). I've tried to provide enough commentary on the
configuration so that it might be useful to those new to emacs or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][text-editors]]
generally. One important thing to note is that the configuration uses [[http://www.vim.org][vim]]
keybindings, as I used vim (or [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]) prior to emacs and I think modal bindings are
best. If you like vim bindings but don't tend to want to think about configuring
emacs, I strongly recommend [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]] or [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]] as a way of managing your
configuration. For a more traditional emacs feel there are also the configurations of
[[Https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Batsov (prelude)]], [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Zhang (Centaur Emacs)]], and [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][many others]]. For a minimally
sane setup you might also look at some [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][sensible defaults]]. My configuration is
influenced by [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas Rougier's]] work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]]; see also the
[[https://github.com/gilbertw1/bmacs][bmacs]] configuration of Bryan Gilbert (see also his [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter][literate starter kit]]) and [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs][Karl
Voit's]] config. Some other good emacs starter kits to look at include John Kitchen's
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][scimax]] and Kieran Healy's [[https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit][social sciences starter kit]].

This config is based on a series of "[[file:setup-config/][modules]]" loaded in the [[file:init.el][init.el]] file. Please see
that file and the various config "helper" functions for navigation. The modules are
organized thematically rather than package by package (e.g. the [[file:setup-config/setup-writing.el][writing module]]
contains the config for spelling and markdown mode). Note that while I have an
[[file:early-init.el][early-init]] file for use with emacs 27+, the configuration should work with emacs 26+
on MacOS (though I haven't tested this in awhile), with the latest release being
best (I'm currently on emacs 28)

Some highlights of this emacs setup include:

1. Short start up time -- starts in roughly 1 sec (this may vary
   with your system)
2. Uses [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
3. Comprehensive [[file:setup-config/setup-keybindings.el][keybindings]] using [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] and spacebar as my leader key
4. [[file:setup-config/setup-evil.el][Evil mode]]
5. Sensible [[file:setup-config/setup-settings.el][defaults]]
6. [[file:setup-config/setup-dired.el][Dired]] with good colors and evil keybindings
7. Completion with [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][selectrum]] and [[file:setup-config/setup-completion.el][related packages]]
8. Custom [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/bespoke-themes][bespoke]] theme (inspired by [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], with toggles for
   dark/light mode)
9. An attractive custom [[file:setup-config/setup-modeline.el][headerline]] (inspired by [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]])
10. Extensive [[file:setup-config/setup-osx.el][MacOS integration]]
11. Single frame [[file:setup-config/setup-projects.el][project]] workflow with [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]], and [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][perspectives]]
12. A configurable [[file:setup-config/setup-splash.el][splash page]]
13. A [[file:setup-config/setup-writing.el][writing-centric]] configuration with markdown, [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]], [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][zettel notes]], and [[file:setup-config/setup-org.el][org-mode]]

    
For more information please take a look at the individual [[file:setup-config/][configuration files]]. Please
note that I'm by no means a competent programmer, so I'm sure there are better ways
of implementing many elements of this config. Suggestions are welcome!
