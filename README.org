These are my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration files. The files are updated/tweaked regularly. I
use emacs for all my [[https://www.colinmclear.net/posts/texteditor/][academic work]] and the configuration tends in that direction.
I've tried to provide enough commentary on the configuration so that it might be
useful to those new to emacs or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][text-editors]] generally. One important thing to note
is that the configuration uses [[http://www.vim.org][vim]] keybindings as I used vim (or [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]) prior to
emacs and I think modal bindings are best. If you like vim bindings but don't tend to
want to think about configuring emacs, I strongly recommend [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]] or [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]]
as a way of managing your configuration. For a more traditional emacs feel there are
also the configurations of [[Https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Batsov (prelude)]], [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Zhang (Centaur Emacs)]], and [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][many
others]]. For a minimally sane setup you might also look at some [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][sensible defaults]]. My
configuration is also influenced by the [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/bmacs][bmacs]] configuration of Bryan Gilbert (see
also his [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter][literate starter kit]]) and [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs][Karl Voit's]] config. Some other good emacs starter
kits to look at include John Kitchen's [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][scimax]] and Kieran Healy's [[https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit][social sciences
starter kit]].

This config is based on a series of "[[file:setup-config/][modules]]" loaded in the [[file:init.el][init.el]] file. Please see
that file and the various config "[[https://github.com/mclear-tools/dotemacs/blob/0d01e6ba684291bab877145acc35081a6b7d1c45/init.el#L334][helper]]" functions for navigation. The modules are
organized thematically rather than package by package (e.g. the [[file:setup-config/setup-writing.el][writing module]]
contains the config for spelling and markdown mode). Note that while I have an
[[file:early-init.el][early-init]] file for use with emacs 27, the configuration is tested to work with emacs
25+ on MacOS, with the latest stable release being best.

Some highlights of this emacs setup include:

1. Short start up time -- when byte-compiled starts in roughly 1 sec (this may vary
   with your system)
2. Uses [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
3. Comprehensive [[file:setup-config/setup-keybindings.el][keybindings]] using [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] and spacebar as my leader key
4. [[file:setup-config/setup-evil.el][Evil mode]]
5. Sensible [[file:setup-config/setup-settings.el][defaults]]
6. [[file:setup-config/setup-dired.el][Dired]] with good colors and evil keybindings
7. Completion with [[file:setup-config/setup-helm.el][helm]] and [[file:setup-config/setup-ivy.el][ivy/counsel]] (ivy is emphasized over helm)
8. Use of [[file:setup-config/setup-posframe.el][posframe]] for most completion windows
9. Custom [[file:setup-config/setup-theme.el][solarized]] theme (mac-centric with toggles for dark/light mode)
10. An attractive [[file:setup-config/setup-modeline.el][modeline]] (based on [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][Doom modeline]])
11. Extensive [[file:setup-config/setup-osx.el][MacOS integration]]
12. Single frame [[file:setup-config/setup-projects.el][project]] workflow with [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]], and [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][perspectives]]
13. A nice [[file:setup-config/setup-dashboard.el][dashboard]] homescreen
14. A [[file:setup-config/setup-writing.el][writing-centric]] configuration with markdown, [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]], [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][zettel notes]], and [[file:setup-config/setup-org.el][org-mode]]
