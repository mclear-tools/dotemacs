- Originates with ancient Greek study of nature
- Philosophy means "love of wisdom" (φιλοσοφία, "/philosophia/")
# - Original form of organized inquiry

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
  things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
  broadest possible sense of the term
  
  ---Wilfrid Sellars
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  We'll look at how things hang together in a variety of areas. 
  
  - metaphysics: is reality ultimately physical?
  - mind: consciousness and representation
  - ethics: what is goodness? is there a meaning to life?
  - epistemology: what can we be certain about?

-  Argument: :: A statement or sequence of statements (truth claims
   called ‘premises') which logically support the truth of some further
   statement (a truth claim called a ‘conclusion').
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Contrast argument w/rhetoric: 
- rhetoric aims to persuade
- argument aims at truth
#+END_NOTES

*** Parts of an Argument

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Evidence ("premises")
-  What follows from the premises ("conclusion")
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Both premises and conclusion must consist of statements or
propositions---i.e. sentences that can be true or false

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Declarative statements: "This class is boring"
-  Hypothetical statements: "If the class is boring it is probably easy"
-  False statements: "PHIL 101 is an easy A"
-  +Questions+: "What is the meaning of life?"
-  +Commands+: "Run away!"

*** Kinds of Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Deductive Argument: :: the conclusion follows from the premises
   /necessarily/
-  Inductive Argument: :: the conclusion is made /probable/ by the
   premises
-  Abductive Argument: :: the conclusion is the /best explanation/ of
   the truth of the premises
     
*** A Simple Deductive Argument

2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Assessing the argument
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Assuming that the premises are true, could the conclusion be false?
  - Does the conclusion follow from the premises?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
-  Philosophers understand the notion of "following from" in terms of
   the /structure/ of the deductive argument
-  Arguments with the right structure are /valid/ deductive arguments
#+END_NOTES
  
*** Structure
1. All humans are mortal  
2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal
   
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. All A are B
2. x is A
3. ∴ x is B
   
*** Validity & Soundness
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Valid Argument: :: An argument whose structure /guarantees/ that, if
   the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true
-  Sound Argument: :: A valid argument whose premises are /true/

*** Argument Extraction
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Is there an argument being made?
2. What's the conclusion of the argument?
3. What support does the conclusion have?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There is no reason to think that there are any absolute moral truths.
  We can see this when we consider different cultural outlooks
  concerning what is morally required. For example, indigenous Inuit
  culture considered infanticide to be morally permissible in some
  situations. But modern American culture clearly thinks infanticide is
  always morally wrong. So what's morally right or wrong is just a
  matter of opinion, which can vary from culture to culture. (James
  Rachels, /The Elements of Moral Theory/)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Conclusion?
  - There are no absolute moral truths

* The Logic of Argument

** Parts of an Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
- Premise (evidence) 
- Conclusion (what follows from the evidence) 
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- An argument consists of *statements*, which can be true or false
- No *questions* or *commands* as part of an argument
#+END_NOTES

** Kinds of Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
-  Deductive Argument: :: the conclusion follows from the premises
   /necessarily/
-  Inductive Argument: :: the conclusion is made /probable/ by the
   premises
-  Abductive Argument: :: the conclusion is the best explanation of the
   truth of the premises
     
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Why do we want to make arguments in the first place? (convince others rationally)
#+END_NOTES

** Characteristics of Deductive Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
-  Validity
-  Soundness

** Validity

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  An argument whose form /guarantees/ that, if the premises are true, the
  conclusion must also be true
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- An argument which is (i) valid and (ii) has true premises

  /content/
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Not all valid arguments are sound arguments
  - Not all arguments with true premises and a true conclusion are sound

** Interpreting Arguments

*** Argument Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Arguments are /constructed/ from statements but they typically don't
   appear as lists of statements
-  (Good) Arguments often contain "marker" words, which indicate what is
   evidence or conclusion

*** Sample Evidence Markers

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- as
- because
- for
- from
- since
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: The streets are wet /because/ it is raining
#+END_NOTES

*** Sample Conclusion Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- hence
- so
- then
- therefore
- thus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: It is raining, /therefore/ the streets are wet

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- What form does this argument look to have (modus tollens)
- Is the argument really MT? (No)
- There is an equivocation with respect to (2). So the argument as
  actually stated is invalid. There is a difference between:
  1. What is considered morally right/wrong varies with culture
  2. What *is* morally right/wrong varies with culture
- For the argument to be valid we need the latter version of (2)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they
  are correct, demonstrate that the existence of moral responsibility
  entails the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does
  not exist, moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however,
  evident that moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such
  thing as moral responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it
  is evident that there are states of affairs to which one can point and
  say, correctly, to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen
  “How to Think”)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. If there were no such thing as moral responsibility, then no one

  we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the

  explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently

  If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must
  themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their
  subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The

  with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an
  objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view (437).

  if the facts of experience---facts about what it is like for the

  We appear to be faced with a general difficulty about psycho-physical
  reduction. In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the
  direction of greater objectivity, toward a more accurate view of the
  real nature of things...Experience itself, however, does not seem to
  fit the pattern. The idea of moving from appearance to reality seems
  to make no sense here. What is the analogue in this case to pursuing a
  more objective understanding of the same phenomena by abandoning the
  initial subjective viewpoint toward them in favor of another that is
  more objective but concerns the same thing? (444)

** Three Arguments Against Physicalism
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. The “What it's like” Argument
2. The Modal Argument
3. The Knowledge Argument

** Nagel's Argument on "What it's like"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Nagel speaks as if the problem he is raising is one of extrapolating
  from knowledge of one experience to another, of imagining what an
  unfamiliar experience would be like on the basis of familiar ones...It
  is hard to see an objection to Physicalism here. Physicalism makes no
  special claims about the imaginative or extrapolative powers of human
  beings, and it is hard to see why it need do so. (Jackson, 132)
#+END_QUOTE

** The Modal Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If physicalism were true, then the complete physical information
   about a subject would entail an answer as to whether she was
   phenomenally conscious
2. But no amount of physical information about a person logically
   entails that a person is phenomenally conscious---i.e. phenomenal
   zombies are logically possible
3. \therefore Physicalism is false

** Objecting to the Modal Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Premise (2) is very controversial
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  only people who are antecedently suspicious of physicalism would
      be likely to agree with (2)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

   seem as controversial to someone sympathetic to physicalism

** The Knowledge Argument

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to
  investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and
  white television monitor. She specialises in the neurophysiology of
  vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information
  there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or
  the sky, and use terms like ‘red', ‘blue', and so on....What will
  happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given
  a colour television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?
  (Jackson, 130)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world
  and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her
  previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical

  false (Jackson, 130).

** Two Versions of the Knowledge Argument

*** The Weaker (Epistemological) Version
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Mary has complete physical knowledge of the facts about human color
   vision before her release from the room
2. But there is some kind of knowledge she lacks before leaving the room
3. $\therefore$ There is some kind of knowledge concerning human color
   vision that is non-physical knowledge

*** The Stronger (Metaphysical) Version
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Mary knows all the physical facts regarding color/color vision
2. But there are some facts about color/color vision which Mary doesn't
   know prior to her release
3. \therefore There are non-physical facts concerning color/color
   vision

*** Which Argument?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Physicalism is compatible with there being ways of knowing physical
   facts that don't use physical concepts---“old facts in new guises”
-  Only the stronger metaphysical version of the argument is a threat to
   physicalism
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Physicalism must deny the existence of any non-physical facts

** Advantages of the Knowledge Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [qualia] serve merely to soothe the intuitions of dualists, and it is left

  we do not and cannot understand the how and why of them. (Jackson, 135)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

      nature of everything that does or could exist
   -  But perhaps there is reason to be humble about what we could
      possibly know of the natural world

** The Humility Argument
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  consider the antecedent probability that everything in the Universe be
  of a kind that is relevant in some way or other to the survival of
  homosapiens. It is very low surely. But then one must admit that it is
  very likely that there is a part of the whole scheme of things, maybe
  a big part, which no amount of evolution will ever bring us near to
  knowledge about or understanding. For the simple reason that such
  knowledge and understanding is irrelevant to survival (Jackson, 135)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear appear appear)
1. Our capacity to understand the natural world depends on our evolved
   acquisition of various cognitive capacities
2. The acquisition of cognitive capacities via evolution depends on
   their conduciveness to human survival
3. At least some cognitive capacities conducive to knowing the natural
   world are not conducive to survival
4. $\therefore$ At least some knowledge of the world is unavailable to
   us because it is not conducive to our survival

** Physicalist Optimism

   is broadly complete and correct?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

  The wonder is that we understand as much as we do, and there is no

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
-  Cognitive scientists and philosophers often begin discussion
   consciousness by pointing to phenomena involving P-consciousness.
-  But the theories they construct to explain the relevant phenomena
   typically end of addressing cognitive issues involving
   A-consciousness
-  Phenomenal and access consciousness are distinct kinds of
   consciousness but are easily confused in both philosophy and in
   empirical research on consciousness

*** Super-Blindsight
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now imagine something that may not exist, what we might call
  super-blindsight. A real blindsight patient can only guess when given
  a choice from a small set of alternatives. But suppose...that a
  blindsight patient could be trained to prompt himself at will,
  guessing what is in the blind field without being told to guess. The
  super-blindsighter spontaneously says ‘‘Now I know that there is a
  horizontal line in my blind field even though I don't actually see
  it.'' Visual information from his blind field simply pops into his
  thoughts in the way that solutions to problems we've been worrying
  about pop into our thoughts, or in the way some people just know the
  time or which way is north without having any perceptual experience of
  it (Block, 283)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

  For example, Searle, quoting Penfield, describes the epileptic walker
  as ‘‘thread[ing] his way'' through the crowd. Doesn't he see the
  obstacles he avoids? Suppose he gets home by turning right at a red
  wall. Isn't there something it is like for him to see the red
  wall---and isn't it different from what it is like for him to see a
  green wall? (Block, 188)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
1. In Penfield's seizure cases it is the subject's thought processes
   that are most obviously deficient, including a clear lack of
   A-consciousness
2. P-consciousness is a feature of mental /states/ not /subjects/
3. There is no reason to think that the states which occur in the
   subjects of Penfield cases lack P-consciousness
4. $\therefore$ There is no reason to think that a function of
   P-consciousness is to make possible flexible and creative complex
   behavior

*** Blindsight

-  'Blindsighted' patients lack consciousness (in some sense) of regions
   of their visual field but have a better than chance ability to
   discriminate objects in those "blind" parts of the visual field

*** The Blindsight Case:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Conscious awareness of a water fountain to my right will lead me to
  drink from it if I am thirsty. But the thirsty blindsighted person
  will make no move towards the fountain unless pressed to do so. The
  inference to the best explanation is that conscious awareness of the
  environment facilitates semantic comprehension and adaptive motor
  actions in creatures like us (Flanagan, quoted in Block, pp. 192-3)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Block's Objection
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Assume that, in blindsighted subjects, /both/ A and P-consciousness
   are missing
2. The explanation of the blindsighter's degraded behavior only requires
   an appeal to A-consciousness and its absence
3. A-consciousness and P-consciousness are at least conceptually
   distinct
4. $\therefore$ Nothing can be inferred in the blindsight case
   concerning the function of P-consciousness

*** Is P-Consciousness Necessary for A-Consciousness?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  It is possible that P-consciousness is necessary for A-consciousness,
   and that it is a necessary condition for creative flexible behavior
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

-  P and A-consciousness may be closely linked biologically
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

         appealing to the mental states of subjects /doing the

*** Convention & Interpretation
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  words, like pictures, do not represent in themselves
  (‘intrinsically'). They need interpreting -- they need an
  interpretation assigned to them in some way. But how can we explain
  this? The natural answer, I think, is that interpretation is something
  which the mind bestows upon words. (Crane, p. 22)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Fundamentality
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Any representational system that depends on interpretation or
   convention is not fundamental
2. Linguistic and pictoral representation depend on interpretation and
   convention
3. $\therefore$ Linguistic and pictoral representation are not
   fundamental

** Is Mental Representation Fundamental?

*** Mental representation is not conventional
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Conventions rely on the intentions of a subject or subjects
- Intentions are a kind of mental representation
- Convention cannot be used to /explain/ mental representation

*** Mental representation does not depend on interpretation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If mental representation required interpretation then we would need
   to be able to think about the interpretations in some way, in order
   to use them as interpretations
2. But thoughts are a form of mental representation, so we would need a
   further interpretation to make sense of those thoughts
3. But a further thought would be needed to think /that/ interpretation,
   etc.
4. $\therefore$ We would have an infinite regress of thoughts and interpretations of them
5. $\therefore$ Mental representations do not require interpretation

  same, I am totally ignorant of Chinese. And there is no way I could
  come to understand Chinese in the system as described, since there is

  My response to the systems theory is quite simple: let the individual
  internalize all of these elements of the system. He memorizes the

  all the calculations in his head. The individual then incorporates the
  entire system. There isn't anything at all to the system that he does
  not encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works
  outdoors. All the same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a
  fortiori neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the

  Programs are abstract computational objects and are purely syntactic.
  Certainly, no mere program is a candidate for possession of a mind.
  Implementations of programs, on the other hand, are concrete systems
  with causal dynamics, and are not purely syntactic. An implementation
  has causal heft in the real world, and it is in virtue of this causal
  heft that consciousness and intentionality arise. It is the program
  that is syntactic; it is the implementation that has semantic content.

  say, “I really should have had a peach instead,” if you /couldn't/ have
  chosen a peach instead? It certainly wouldn't make sense to say it if
  there /was no/ fruit. So how can it make sense if there /was/ fruit, but

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When we excuse a person who has been coerced, we do not excuse him
  because he was unable to do otherwise. Even though a person is subject

  action. (Frankfurt, 834)

** The Case of Jones

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Jones decides for reasons of his own to do something, then someone
  threatens him with a very harsh penalty (so harsh that any reasonable
  person would submit to the threat) unless he does precisely that, and
  Jones does it. Will we hold Jones morally responsible for what he has
  done? I think this will depend on the roles we think were played, in
  leading him to act, by his original decision and by the threat.
  (Frankfurt, 831)
#+END_QUOTE

** Versions of the Case

-  Jones_{1}: Always does what he decides to do; the threat plays no
   role
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  responsible for acting
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Jones_{2}: The threat totally overpowers Jones; he does what the
   threat says, no matter what he decided earlier
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  not responsible for acting
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Jones_{3}: Weighs decision and threat evenly, but ultimately acts on
   his original reasons rather than the threat
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  responsible for acting

** Responsibility & PAP

-  Claim: Jones_{1-3} show that PAP plays no role in evaluation of moral
   responsibility
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Assignment of moral responsibility depends on evaluating /the reasons
   for which one acted/, not whether one could have done otherwise
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Jones_{1} and Jones_{3} acted on the basis of bad motives, that is
      why they are responsible

** Coercion with Responsibility?

-  The Jones case counts as coercion only if Jones acts /because of/ the
   threat
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Coercion requires that the coerced subject act /because of/ the
   coercive force exerted on her
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Only the case of Jones_{2} is a case of genuine coercion
     
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Emphasize the difference between action in the *presence* of a threat
  and action *on the basis* of a threat.
  - Only the latter counts as coercion
#+END_NOTES
     
** Objection 

-  Is the case of Jones_{3} a clear counterexample to the claim that
   coercion/manipulation excuses?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  The presence of the threat in the Jones_{3} case does not meant
      that he /could not/ have done otherwise
     
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Is this case relevantly like the "your money or your life" (or the jewelry) situation?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  His knowledge that he stands to suffer an intolerably harsh penalty
  does not mean that Jones_{3}, strictly speaking, /cannot/ perform any
  action but the one he does perform. After all it is still open to him,
  and this is crucial, to defy the threat if he wishes to do so and to
  accept the penalty his action would bring down upon him. In the sense
  in which the principle of alternate possibilities employs the concept
  of "could have done otherwise," Jones_{3}'s inability to resist the
  threat does not mean that he cannot do otherwise than perform the
  action he performs. Hence the case of Jones_{3} does not constitute an
  instance contrary to the principle. (Frankfurt, 834)
#+END_QUOTE

#+END_NOTES

** Response -- Jones_{4}

- Jones_4: acts for his own reasons, but if there was any sign of his
  acting differently, would have been forced to carry out the act anyway

#+BEGIN_NOTES

  Suppose someone--Black, let us say--wants Jones_{4} to perform a
  certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get
  his way, but he prefers to avoid showing his hand unnecessarily. So he
  waits until Jones_{4} is about to make up his mind what to do, and he
  does nothing unless it is clear to him (Black is an excellent judge of
  such things) that Jones_{4} is going to decide to do something /other/
  than what he wants him to do. If it does become clear that Jones_{4}
  is going to decide to do something else, Black takes effective steps
  to ensure that Jones_{4} decides to do, and that he does do, what he
  wants him to do. Whatever Jones_{4}'s initial preferences and
  inclinations, then, Black will have his way. (Frankfurt, 835)

  suppose that Black never has to show his hand because Jones_{4}, for
  reasons of his own, decides to perform and does perform the very
  action Black wants him to perform. In that case, it seems clear,
  Jones_{4} will bear precisely the same moral responsibility for what
  he does as he would have borne if Black had not been ready to take
  steps to ensure that he do it. (Frankfurt, 836)

   otherwise

** Free Will & Indeterminism

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  perhaps [determinism] isn't true. Many scientists now believe that it
  isn't true for the basic particles of matter-that in a given
  situation, there's more than one thing that an electron may do.
  Perhaps if determinism isn't true for human actions, either, this
  leaves room for free will and responsibility. What if human actions,
  or at least some of them, are not determined in advance? (Nagel, 55)

  is even [indeterminism] enough for free will? Is this all you mean
  when you say, “I could have chosen fruit instead?”-that the choice
  wasn't determined in advance? No, you believe something more. You
  believe that /you/ determined what you would do, by /doing/ it. It
  wasn't determined in advance, but it didn't /just happen/, either.
  /You did it/, and you could have done the opposite. (Nagel, 53)

** Strawson's 'Basic Argument'
*** First Statement
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Nothing can be the cause of itself
2. In order to be truly morally responsible for one's actions one would
   have to be the cause of oneself in some crucial respects
3. \therefore No one can be truly morally responsible

*** Questions About the Basic Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Why does being morally responsible require being self-caused?
-  What 'crucial respects' must be caused?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  character
   -  evaluative dispositions & preferences

*** Strawson's Revision
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. You do what you do because of the way you are.
2. To be morally responsible for what you do you must be truly morally
   responsible for the way you are -- at least in certain crucial mental
   respects.
3. To be truly responsible for the way you are, you must have
   intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are, and this
   is impossible.
4. \therefore You cannot be truly morally responsible for what you do,
   because you cannot be truly responsible for the way you are.

** What is 'True moral responsibility'?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  As I understand it, true moral responsibility is responsibility of
  such a kind that, if we have it, then it makes sense, at least, to
  suppose that it could be just to punish some of us with (eternal)
  torment in hell and reward others with (eternal) bliss in heaven...The
  story of heaven and hell is useful simply because it illustrates, in a
  particularly vivid way, the kind of absolute or ultimate
  accountability or responsibility that many have supposed themselves to
  have, and that many do still suppose themselves to have. (Strawson,
  9-10)

  Libet asked his subjects to flex their wrists at any time they wanted
  and then report the location of a dot moving quickly around a clock
  face when they first felt the urge or intention to flex their wrists.
  Throughout this process, he recorded their neural activity (with EEG)
  as well as their wrist movements (with EMG)...That activity [called a
  ‘Readiness Potential' or RP] ramped up slowly, reaching its pinnacle
  at the time when bodily movement began, and then fell quickly after
  movement...(Sinnott-Armstrong, 238)

  movement (M) began, and the reported time of conscious will (W) was
  around 150--200 ms before the hand movement (M) began, so the
  readiness potential...began around 350--400 ms before the reported
  time of conscious will (W). This order suggests that conscious will
  does not initiate the readiness potential...This implication is
  surprising, because most people think that their conscious choice is
  what begins the process that makes their body move in such cases.

   difference between the linguistic behavior of a person and that of a
   machine
2. If there is no discernible difference in linguistic behavior between

*** Determinism & Free Will

1. Is the truth of determinism compatible with free will?

   -  Yes: Compatibilism
   -  No: Incompatibilism


*** Alternative Possibilities & Incompatibilism

-  Why might determinism & freedom be incompatible?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Determinism is like /coercion/ or /manipulation/
   -  Coercion/manipulation deprives us of the /power or ability to do
      or choose otherwise/.

*** Question 2

The Principle of Alternate Possibilities says:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A. Moral responsibility requires being able to do otherwise\\
  B. Moral responsibility requires being able to act on reasons\\
  C. We could never do otherwise than what we have done\\
  D. We could at least sometimes do otherwise that what we do\\
#+END_QUOTE

*** Alternative Possibilities & Incompatibilism

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  The Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP): :: a person is
   morally responsible for what s/he has done only if s/he could have
   done otherwise (or chosen otherwise)
-  Leeway Incompatibilism: :: The truth of determinism is incompatible
   with an agent's having the capacity to do otherwise than as she did

*** Question 3

According to Frankfurt, determinism and free will are compatible
because:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A. We couldn't have chosen otherwise\\
  B. Responsibility is based on the reasons for which we act\\
  C. Determinism is false\\
  D. We can always choose to do otherwise\\
#+END_QUOTE

** Free Will & Control
*** Question 1

The source requirement says that

A. we have free will\\
B. moral responsibility depends on being able to do otherwise\\
C. control is irrelevant to moral responsibility\\
D. responsibility for a choice requires that one be the appropriate source of
the choice

*** Agency & Control

-  The Source Requirement: :: If an agent is morally responsible for her
   deciding to perform an action, then the production of this decision
   must be something over which the agent has /control/, and an agent is
   not morally responsible for the decision if it is produced by a
   source over which she has no control

*** Question 2

Determinism says that:

A. we cannot make any choices\\
B. our choices are not causally effective\\
C. our current states are necessitated by our past states in
conjunction with physical laws\\
D. we are free

*** Determinism

-  Determinism: :: For any state of the subject, that subject's states
   are necessitated by the condition of its previous states plus the
   laws of nature.

*** Question 3

If determinism is false then we have free will

A. True\\
B. False

*** Question 4

You cannot be truly responsible for the way you are because

A. you cannot do otherwise than you do\\
B. determinism is true\\
C. determinism is false\\
D. in certain crucial respects you cannot have intentionally brought
it about that you are as you are now

*** Strawson's Argument
1. You do what you do because of the way you are.
2. To be morally responsible for what you do you must be truly morally
   responsible for the way you are -- at least in certain crucial mental
   respects.
3. To be truly responsible for the way you are, you must have
   intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are
4. It is impossible to have intentionally brought about how one is
5. \therefore You cannot be truly morally responsible for what you do,
   because you cannot be truly responsible for the way you are

*** Question 5

Why does Strawson think that it is absurd to believe that you could have
intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are now?

A. Determinism is true\\
B. We cannot do otherwise than we do\\
C. No one is truly morally responsible\\
D. We would need to appeal to an infinite number of different characters or
natures to explain any intentional action

#+REVEAL: split
1. Suppose that you have somehow intentionally brought it about that you
   are the way you now are, and that you have brought this about in such
   a way that you can now be said to be truly responsible for being the
   way you now are
2. Your intentional act, for which you are responsible, is due to some
   nature N
3. If you are truly responsible for this act you must be truly
   responsible for having the nature N in virtue of which you
   intentionally brought it about that you are the way you now are
4. \therefore You must have intentionally brought about N, which
   requires that you have some further nature N1, in virtue of which you
   brought about your nature N... (absurd infinite regress ensues)
5. \therefore It is impossible for you to have intentionally brought
   it about that you are as you are now

#+REVEAL: split
Are we truly morally responsible for our actions?

A. Yes\\
B. No
