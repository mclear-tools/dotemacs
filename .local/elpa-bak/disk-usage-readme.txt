Warning: BSD and macOS users need `gdu`, the "GNU du" from the "GNU
coreutils".

Disk Usage is a file system analyzer: it offers a tabulated view of file
listings sorted by size.  Directory sizes are computed recursively.  The results
are cached for speed.

Run `disk-usage' or `disk-usage-here' to display a listing.
See `describe-mode' for additional bindings, such as
`disk-usage-dired-at-point' to open a `dired' buffer for the current
directory.

Instead of displaying only the current folder, `disk-usage' can also display
files in all subfolders recursively with `disk-usage-toggle-recursive'.

Marked files can be trashed with `disk-usage-delete-marked-files'.  When
called with a prefix argument, files are deleted permanently.

Run `disk-usage-by-types' to display statistics of disk usage by file
extensions.

With a prefix argument, cache is updated when reverting the buffer.

With `disk-usage-add-filters' you can filter out files with arbitrary
predicates, e.g. files bigger than some size or older than a certain number
of days.

You can customize options in the 'disk-usage group.
