Turning on `helm-descbinds-mode' is the recommended way to
install this command to replace `describe-bindings'.

You complete against a list of keys + command pairs presented in
a similar way as `describe-bindings' does, split into sections
defined by the types of the key bindings (minor and major modes,
global bindings, etc).

The default action executes a command as if the binding had been
entered, or narrows the commands according to a prefix key,
respectively.

The persistent action pops up a help buffer for the selected
command without quitting.

For key translation maps, the default actions are not very
useful, yet they are listed for completeness.
