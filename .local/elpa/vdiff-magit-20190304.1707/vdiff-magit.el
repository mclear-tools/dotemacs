(defcustom vdiff-magit-show-stash-with-index t
  "Whether `vdiff-magit-show-stash' shows the state of the index.

If non-nil, use a third vdiff buffer to distinguish which changes
in the stash were staged.  In cases where the stash contains no
staged changes, fall back to a two-buffer vdiff.

More specificaly, a stash is a merge commit, stash@{N}, with
potentially three parents.

* stash@{N}^1 represents the HEAD commit at the time the stash
  was created.

* stash@{N}^2 records any changes that were staged when the stash
  was made.

* stash@{N}^3, if it exists, contains files that were untracked
  when stashing.

If this option is non-nil, `vdiff-magit-show-stash' will run
vdiff on a file using three buffers: one for stash@{N}, another
for stash@{N}^1, and a third for stash@{N}^2.

Otherwise, vdiff uses two buffers, comparing
stash@{N}^1..stash@{N}.  Along with any unstaged changes, changes
in the index commit, stash@{N}^2, will be shown in this
comparison unless they conflicted with changes in the working
tree at the time of stashing."

requiring a 3-way merge it will abort and forward to
`magit-ediff-resolve' instead. The purpose of this flag is to
make the merge experience consistent across all types of
merges."
