# Introduction

This emacs module implements a bridge to libvterm to display a terminal in a
emacs buffer.

This is a **alpha-release**, so it will crash your emacs. If it does, please
report a bug!

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm.git
```

Before install emacs-libvterm,you need make sure you have 
installed
 1. cmake (>=3.0.2)
 2. libtool-bin related issues: [#66](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/66) [#85](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/85#issuecomment-491845136) 
 
Run the build:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..

```

And add this to your `init.el`:

```

# Debugging and testing

If you have successfully build the module, you can test the module by executing
the following command in the `build` directory:

```
make run
```

# Usage

## `vterm`

Open a terminal in the current window.

## `vterm-other-window`

Open a terminal in another window.

# Customization

## `vterm-shell`

Shell to run in a new vterm. Defaults to `$SHELL`.

## Keybindings

If you want a key to be send to the terminal bind it to `vterm--self-insert`,
otherwise remove it from `vterm-mode-map`. By default vterm.el binds most of the

like `<backspace>` and `<return>`. Sending a keyboard interrupt is by default
bound to `C-c C-c`.
