This package defines three main functions: `0x0-upload',
`0x0-upload-file' and `0x0-upload-string', which respectively upload
(parts of) the current buffer, a file on your disk and a string from
the minibuffer to a 0x0.st comparable server.

Besides the built-in `url' library, this package has no dependencies,
especially no external ones, such as curl.

See https://0x0.st/ for more details, and consider donating to
