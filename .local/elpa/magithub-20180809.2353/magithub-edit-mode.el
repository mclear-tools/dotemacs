'Edit' buffers provide a common interface and handling for

CANCEL is a function to use upon \\[magithub-edit-cancel].

CONTENT is initial content for the buffer.  It is considered
novel and the buffer will not be closed without prompting to save
a draft.

FILE is the file to use for drafts of this post.

HEADER is a title to use in the header line of the new buffer.

If PROMPT-DISCARD-DRAFT is non-nil, this function will display
the draft before offering to delete it.  This option is
recommended when using \\[universal-argument] with the command
that calls this function.

SUBMIT is a function to use upon \\[magithub-edit-submit].

ask to save a draft here if post is cancelled."
