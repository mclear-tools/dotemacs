(autoload 'annalist-record "annalist" "\
In the store for ANNALIST, TYPE, and LOCAL, record RECORD.
ANNALIST should correspond to the package/user recording this information (e.g.
'general, 'me, etc.). TYPE is the type of information being recorded (e.g.
'keybindings). LOCAL corresponds to whether to store RECORD only for the current
buffer. This information together is used to select where RECORD should be
stored in and later retrieved from with `annalist-describe'. RECORD should be a
list of items to record and later print as org headings and column entries in a
single row. If PLIST is non-nil, RECORD should be a plist instead of an ordered
list (e.g. '(keymap org-mode-map key \"C-c a\" ...)). The plist keys should be
the symbols used for the definition of TYPE.

\(fn ANNALIST TYPE RECORD &key LOCAL PLIST)" nil nil)

(autoload 'annalist-describe "annalist" "\
Describe information recorded by ANNALIST for TYPE.
For example: (annalist-describe 'general 'keybindings) If VIEW is non-nil, use
those settings for displaying recorded information instead of the defaults.

\(fn ANNALIST TYPE &optional VIEW)" nil nil)
