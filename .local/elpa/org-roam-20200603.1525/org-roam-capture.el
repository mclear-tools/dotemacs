The capture templates are an extension of

`org-capture-templates' are extended in 3 ways:

1. Template expansion capabilities are extended with additional custom syntax.
   See `org-roam-capture--fill-template' for more details.

2. The `:file-name' key is added, which expands to the file-name
   of the note if it creates a new file.  This file-name is
   relative to `org-roam-directory', and is without the
   file-extension.

3. The `:head' key is added, which contains the template that is
   inserted on initial creation (added only once).  This is where
   insertion of any note metadata should go.")
