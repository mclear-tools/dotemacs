1 Introduction
**************

Org-roam is a Roam Research (https://roamresearch.com/) replica built
around the all-powerful Org-mode (https://orgmode.org/).

   Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode.  With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy.  Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution for
anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

   To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
*note Note-taking Workflows::.

   Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible.  Eventually, we hope to
further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

   Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

Privacy and Security
     Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your
     control.  Encrypt your notes with GPG.
Longevity of Plain Text
     Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and
     foremost plain Org-mode files – Org-roam simply builds up an
     auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers.  Having
     your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki.
     Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken
     down.  Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors
     cease to exist
Free and Open Source
     Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel
     unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend
     Org-roam, or open a PR.
Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem
     Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature
     system for plain-text organization.  Building upon Org-mode already
     puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
Built on Emacs
     Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can
     inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages
     available to Emacs.

2.2 Installing from MELPA
=========================

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you haven’t used
Emacs’ package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by
reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see info:emacs#Packages.
Then, add one of the archives to ‘package-archives’:

   • To use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Melpa-Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

   Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

   Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its
dependencies using:

     M-x package-install RET org-roam RET

3 Getting Started
*****************

This short tutorial describes the essential commands used in Org-roam,
to help you get started.

   First, it is important to understand how Org-roam was designed.
Org-roam was built to support a workflow that was not possible with
vanilla Org-mode.  This flow is modelled after the Zettelkasten Method
(https://zettelkasten.de/), and many of Roam Research’s
(https://roamresearch.com) workflows.  Org-roam does not magically make
note-taking better – this often requires a radical change in your
current note-taking workflow.  To understand more about the methods and
madness, see *note Note-taking Workflows::.

   To begin using Org-roam, one should set the ‘org-roam-directory’ to
the directory containing your notes.  For this tutorial, create an empty
directory, and set the ‘org-roam-directory’:

     (make-directory "~/org-roam")
     (setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")

   We encourage using a flat hierarchy for storing notes, but some
prefer using folders for storing specific kinds of notes (e.g.
websites, papers).  This is fine; Org-roam searches recursively within
‘org-roam-directory’ for any notes.  Instead of relying on the file
hierarchy for any form of categorization, we solely rely on links
between files to establish connections between notes.

   Next, we need to enable the global minor mode ‘org-roam-mode’.  This
sets up Emacs with several hooks, builds a cache and keeps it
consistent.  We recommend starting ‘org-roam-mode’ on startup:

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)

   To build the cache manually, one can run ‘M-x
org-roam-db-build-cache’.  The cache is a sqlite database named
‘org-roam.db’, which defaults to residing in the root
‘org-roam-directory’.  Cache builds may take a while the first time, but
is often instantaneous in subsequent runs.

   Let us now create our first note.  Call ‘M-x org-roam-find-file’.
This shows a list of titles for notes that reside in
‘org-roam-directory’.  It should show nothing right now, since there are
no notes in the directory.  Entering the title of the note you wish to
create, and pressing ‘RET’ should begin the note creation process.  This
process uses ‘org-capture’’s templating system, and can be freely
customized (see *note The Templating System::).  Using the default
template, pressing ‘C-c C-c’ finishes the note capture.  Running ‘M-x
org-roam-find-file’ again should show the note you have created, and
selecting that entry will bring you to that note.

   The crux of Org-roam is making it easy to create notes, and link them
together.  To link notes together, we call ‘M-x org-roam-insert’.  This
brings up a prompt with a list of title for existing notes.  Selecting
an existing entry will create and insert a link to the current file.
Entering a non-existent title will create a new note with that title.
Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking files: this
facilitates building up a dense knowledge graph of inter-connected
notes.

   Org-roam provides an interface to view backlinks.  It shows backlinks
for the currently active Org-roam note, along with some surrounding
context.  To toggle the visibility of this buffer, call ‘M-x org-roam’.

   For a visual representation of the notes and their connections,
Org-roam also provides graphing capabilities, using Graphviz.  It
generates graphs with notes as nodes, and links between them as edges.
The generated graph can be used to navigate to the files, but this
requires some additional setup (see *note Roam Protocol: Roam
Protocol.).

4 Anatomy of an Org-roam File
*****************************

The bulk of Org-roam’s functionality is built on top of vanilla
Org-mode.  However, to support additional functionality, Org-roam adds
several Org-roam-specific keywords.  These functionality are not crucial
to effective use of Org-roam.

* Menu:

* Titles::
* Tags::
* File Refs::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Titles,  Next: Tags,  Up: Anatomy of an Org-roam File

4.1 Titles
==========

To easily find a note, a title needs to be prescribed to a note.  A note
can have many titles: this allows a note to be referred to by different
names, which is especially useful for topics or concepts with acronyms.
For example, for a note like “World War 2”, it may be desirable to also
refer to it using the acronym “WWII”.

   Org-roam calls ‘org-roam--extract-titles’ to extract titles.  It uses
the variable ‘org-roam-title-sources’, to control how the titles are
extracted.  The title extraction methods supported are:

  1. ‘'title’: This extracts the title using the file ‘#+TITLE’ property
  2. ‘'headline’: This extracts the title from the first headline in the
     Org file
  3. ‘'alias’: This extracts a list of titles using the ‘#ROAM_ALIAS’
     property.  The aliases are space-delimited, and can be multi-worded
     using quotes

   Take for example the following org file:

     #+TITLE: World War 2
     #+ROAM_ALIAS: "WWII" "World War II"

     * Headline

Method        Titles
-----------------------------------------
‘'title’      ’(“World War 2”)
‘'headline’   ’(“Headline”)
‘'alias’      ’(“WWII” “World War II”)

   One can freely control which extraction methods to use by customizing
‘org-roam-title-sources’: see the doc-string for the variable for more
information.  If all methods of title extraction return no results, the
file-name is used in place of the titles for completions.

   If you wish to add your own title extraction method, you may push a
symbol ‘'foo’ into ‘org-roam-title-sources’, and define a
‘org-roam--extract-titles-foo’ which accepts no arguments.  See
‘org-roam--extract-titles-title’ for an example.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Tags,  Next: File Refs,  Prev: Titles,  Up: Anatomy of an Org-roam File

4.2 Tags
========

Tags are used as meta-data for files: they facilitate interactions with
notes where titles are insufficient.  For example, tags allow for
categorization of notes: differentiating between bibliographical and
structure notes during interactive commands.

   Org-roam calls ‘org-roam--extract-tags’ to extract tags from files.
It uses the variable ‘org-roam-tag-sources’, to control how tags are
extracted.  The tag extraction methods supported are:

  1. ‘'prop’: This extracts tags from the ‘#+ROAM_TAGS’ property.  Tags
     are space delimited, and can be multi-word using double quotes.
  2. ‘'all-directories’: All sub-directories relative to
     ‘org-roam-directory’ are extracted as tags.  That is, if a file is
     located at relative path ‘foo/bar/file.org’, the file will have
     tags ‘foo’ and ‘bar’.
  3. ‘'last-directory’: Extracts the last directory relative to
     ‘org-roam-directory’ as the tag.  That is, if a file is located at
     relative path ‘foo/bar/file.org’, the file will have tag ‘bar’.

   By default, only the ‘'prop’ extraction method is enabled.  To enable
the other extraction methods, you may modify ‘org-roam-tag-sources’:

     (setq org-roam-tag-sources '(prop last-directory))

   If you wish to add your own tag extraction method, you may push a
symbol ‘'foo’ into ‘org-roam-tag-sources’, and define a
‘org-roam--extract-tags-foo’ which accepts the absolute file path as its
argument.  See ‘org-roam--extract-tags-prop’ for an example.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: File Refs,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Anatomy of an Org-roam File

4.3 File Refs
=============

Refs are unique identifiers for files.  Each note can only have 1 ref.
For example, a note for a website may contain a ref:

     #+TITLE: Google
     #+ROAM_KEY: https://www.google.com/

   These keys come in useful for when taking website notes, using the
‘roam-ref’ protocol (see *note Roam Protocol::).

   Alternatively, add a ref for notes for a specific paper, using its
org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) citation key:

     #+TITLE: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
     #+ROAM_KEY: cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat

   The backlinks buffer will show any cites of this key: e.g.

5 The Templating System
***********************

Rather than creating blank files on ‘org-roam-insert’ and
‘org-roam-find-file’, it may be desirable to prefill the file with
templated content.  This may include:

   • Time of creation
   • File it was created from
   • Clipboard content
   • Any other data you may want to input manually

   This requires a complex template insertion system.  Fortunately, Org
ships with a powerful one: ‘org-capture’.  However, org-capture was not
designed for such use.  Org-roam abuses ‘org-capture’, extending its
syntax.  To first understand how org-roam’s templating system works, it
may be useful to look into basic usage of ‘org-capture’.

   Org-roam’s templates can be customized by modifying the variable
‘org-roam-capture-templates’.

* Template Walkthrough::
* Org-roam Template Expansion::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Template Walkthrough,  Next: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Up: The Templating System

5.1 Template Walkthrough
========================

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates.  Here, we
walkthrough the default template, reproduced below.

     ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
          "%?"
          :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}"
          :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n"
          :unnarrowed t)

  1. The template has short key ‘"d"’.  If you have only one template,
     org-roam automatically chooses this template for you.
  2. The template is given a description of ‘"default"’.
  3. ‘plain’ text is inserted.  Other options include Org headings via
     ‘entry’.
  4. ‘(function org-roam--capture-get-point)’ should not be changed.
  5. ‘"%?"’ is the template inserted on each call to
     ‘org-roam-capture--capture’.  This template means don’t insert any
     content, but place the cursor here.
  6. ‘:file-name’ is the file-name template for a new note, if it
     doesn’t yet exist.  This creates a file at path that looks like
     ‘/path/to/org-roam-directory/20200213032037-foo.org’.
  7. ‘:head’ contains the initial template to be inserted (once only),
     at the beginning of the file.  Here, the title global attribute is
     inserted.
  8. ‘:unnarrowed t’ tells org-capture to show the contents for the
     whole file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.

   Other options you may want to learn about include
‘:immediate-finish’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Prev: Template Walkthrough,  Up: The Templating System

5.2 Org-roam Template Expansion
===============================

Org-roam’s template definitions also extend org-capture’s template
syntax, to allow prefilling of strings.  We have seen a glimpse of this
in *note Template Walkthrough: Template Walkthrough.

   In org-roam templates, the ‘${var}’ syntax allows for the expansion
of variables, stored in ‘org-roam-capture--info’.  For example, during
‘org-roam-insert’, the user is prompted for a title.  Upon entering a
non-existent title, the ‘title’ key in ‘org-roam-capture--info’ is set
to the provided title.  ‘${title}’ is then expanded into the provided
title during the org-capture process.  Any variables that do not contain
strings, are prompted for values using ‘completing-read’.

   After doing this expansion, the org-capture’s template expansion
system is used to fill up the rest of the template.  You may read up
more on this on org-capture’s documentation page
(https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion).

   To illustrate this dual expansion process, take for example the
template string: ‘"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${title}"’, with the title ‘"Foo"’.
The template is first expanded into ‘%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-Foo’.  Then
org-capture expands ‘%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>’ with timestamp: e.g.
‘20200213032037-Foo’.

   All of the flexibility afforded by Emacs and Org-mode are available.
For example, if you want to encode a UTC timestamp in the filename, you
can take advantage of org-mode’s ‘%(EXP)’ template expansion to call
‘format-time-string’ directly to provide its third argument to specify
UTC.

     ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
          "%?"
          :file-name "%(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%SZ--${slug}\" (current-time) t)"
          :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n"
          :unnarrowed t)

6 Concepts and Configuration
****************************

The number of configuration options is deliberately kept small, to keep
the Org-roam codebase manageable.  However, we attempt to accommodate as
many usage styles as possible.

   All of Org-roam’s customization options can be viewed via ‘M-x
customize-group org-roam’.

6.1 Directories and Files
=========================

This section concerns the placement and creation of files.

   • Variable: org-roam-directory

     This is the default path to Org-roam files.  All Org files, at any
     level of nesting, are considered part of the Org-roam.

   • Variable: org-roam-db-location

     Location of the Org-roam database.  If this is non-nil, the
     Org-roam sqlite database is saved here.

     It is the user’s responsibility to set this correctly, especially
     when used with multiple Org-roam instances.

6.2 The Org-roam Buffer
=======================

The Org-roam buffer displays backlinks for the currently active Org-roam
note.

   • User Option: org-roam-buffer

     The name of the org-roam buffer.  Defaults to ‘*org-roam*’.

   • User Option: org-roam-buffer-position

     The position of the Org-roam buffer side window.  Valid values are
     ‘'left’, ‘'right’, ‘'top’, ‘'bottom’.

   • User Option: org-roam-buffer-width

     Width of ‘org-roam-buffer’.  Has an effect only if
     ‘org-roam-buffer-position’ is ‘'left’ or ‘'right’.

   • User Option: org-roam-buffer-height

     Height of ‘org-roam-buffer’.  Has an effect only if
     ‘org-roam-buffer-position’ is ‘'top’ or ‘'bottom’.

   • User Option: org-roam-buffer-no-delete-other-windows

     The ‘no-delete-window’ parameter for the org-roam buffer.  Setting
     it to ‘'t’ prevents the window from being deleted when calling
     ‘delete-other-windows’.

6.3 Org-roam Links
==================

Org-roam links are regular ‘file:’ links in Org-mode.  By default, links
are inserted with the title as the link description with
‘org-roam-insert’.

   • User Option: org-roam-link-title-format

     To distinguish between org-roam links and regular links, one may
     choose to use special indicators for Org-roam links.  Defaults to
     ‘"%s"’.

     If your version of Org is at least ‘9.2’, consider styling the link
     differently, by customizing the ‘org-roam-link’, and
     ‘org-roam-link-current’ faces.

7.1 Index File
==============

As your collection grows, you might want to create an index where you
keep links to your main files.

   In Org-roam, you can define the path to your index file by setting
‘org-roam-index-file’.

   • Variable: org-roam-index-file

     Path to the Org-roam index file.

     The path can be a string or a function.  If it is a string, it
     should be the path (absolute or relative to ‘org-roam-directory’)
     to the index file.  If it is is a function, the function should
     return the path to the index file.  Otherwise, the index is assumed
     to be a note in ‘org-roam-index’ whose title is ‘"Index"’.

   • Function: org-roam-find-index

     Opens the Index file in the current ‘org-roam-directory’.

8 Encryption
************

One may wish to keep private, encrypted files.  Org-roam supports
encryption (via GPG), which can be enabled for all new files by setting
‘org-roam-encrypt-files’ to ‘t’.  When enabled, new files are created
with the ‘.org.gpg’ extension and decryption are handled automatically
by EasyPG.

   Note that Emacs will prompt for a password for encrypted files during
cache updates if it requires reading the encrypted file.  To reduce the
number of password prompts, you may wish to cache the password.

   • Variable: org-roam-encrypt-files

     Whether to encrypt new files.  If true, create files with .org.gpg
     extension.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Graphing,  Next: Org-roam Completion System,  Prev: Encryption,  Up: Top

9 Graphing
**********

Org-roam provides graphing capabilities to explore interconnections
between notes.  This is done by performing SQL queries and generating
images using Graphviz (https://graphviz.org/).  The graph can also be
navigated: see *note Roam Protocol::.

   The entry point to graph creation is ‘org-roam-graph’.

   • Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg file node-query

     Build and possibly display a graph for FILE from NODE-QUERY.  If
     FILE is nil, default to current buffer’s file name.  ARG may be any
     of the following values:

        • ‘nil’ show the graph.
        • ‘C-u’ show the graph for FILE.
        • ‘C-u N’ show the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
        • ‘C-u C-u’ build the graph.
        • ‘C-u -’ build the graph for FILE.
        • ‘C-u -N’ build the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

     Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz).  Set this
     if Org-roam is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your
     system.

     You may also choose to use ‘neato’ in place of ‘dot’, which
     generates a more compact graph layout.

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

     Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the
     SVG, but you may choose to set it to:

       1. A string, which is a path to the program used
       2. a function accepting a single argument: the graph file path.

     ‘nil’ uses ‘view-file’ to view the graph.

9.1 Graph Options
=================

Graphviz provides many options for customizing the graph output, and
Org-roam supports some of them.  See
<https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/attrs.html> for customizable
options.

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-extra-config

     Extra options passed to graphviz for the digraph (The “G”
     attributes).  Example: ‘'=(("rankdir" . "LR"))’

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-node-extra-config

     Extra options for nodes in the graphviz output (The “N”
     attributes).  Example: ‘'(("color" . "skyblue"))’

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-extra-config

     Extra options for edges in the graphviz output (The “E”
     attributes).  Example: ‘'(("dir" . "back"))’

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-cites-extra-config

     Extra options for citation edges in the graphviz output.  Example:
     ‘'(("color" . "red"))’

9.2 Excluding Nodes and Edges
=============================

One may want to exclude certain files to declutter the graph.

   • User Option: org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher

     Matcher for excluding nodes from the generated graph.  Any nodes
     and links for file paths matching this string is excluded from the
     graph.

     If value is a string, the string is the only matcher.

     If value is a list, all file paths matching any of the strings are
     excluded.

     (setq org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher '("private" "dailies"))

   This setting excludes all files whose path contain “private” or
“dailies”.

10 Org-roam Completion System
*****************************

Org-roam offers completion when choosing note titles etc.  The
completion system is configurable.  The default setting,

     (setq org-roam-completion-system 'default)

   uses Emacs’ standard ‘completing-read’.  If you prefer Helm
(https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/), use

     (setq org-roam-completion-system 'helm)

   Other options include ‘'ido’, and ‘'ivy’.

Org-roam extending ‘org-protocol’ with 2 protocols: the ‘roam-file’ and
‘roam-ref’ protocol.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installation (1),  Next: The roam-file protocol,  Prev: _ (1),  Up: Roam Protocol

11.2 Installation
=================

To enable Org-roam’s protocol extensions, you have to add the following
to your init file:

     (require 'org-roam-protocol)

   The instructions for setting up ‘org-protocol=’ are reproduced below.

   We will also need to create a desktop application for ‘emacsclient’.
The instructions for various platforms are shown below.

   For Linux users, create a desktop application in
‘~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop’:

     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Org-Protocol
     Exec=emacsclient %u
     Icon=emacs-icon
     Type=Application
     Terminal=false
     MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol

   Associate ‘org-protocol://’ links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

     xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘Org-Protocol Client’ app will be
used without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
     sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
     {
       "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
     }
     EOF
     sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json

   and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to
<chrome://restart>) to make the new policy take effect.

   See here (https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start)
for more info on the ‘/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed’ directory and
here
(https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox)
for information on the ‘ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox’
policy.

   For MacOS, one solution is to use Platypus
(https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus).  Here are the instructions
for setting up with Platypus and Chrome:

  1. Install and launch Platypus (with Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)):

     brew cask install platypus

  1. Create a script ‘launch_emacs.sh’:

     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     /usr/local/bin/emacsclient --no-wait $1

  1. Create a Platypus app with the following settings:

     | Setting                        | Value                     |
     |--------------------------------+---------------------------|
     | App Name                       | "OrgProtocol"             |
     | Script Type                    | "env" · "/usr/bin/env"    |
     | Script Path                    | "path/to/launch-emacs.sh" |
     | Interface                      | None                      |
     | Accept dropped items           | true                      |
     | Remain running after execution | false                     |

   Inside ‘Settings’:

     | Setting                        | Value          |
     |--------------------------------+----------------|
     | Accept dropped files           | true           |
     | Register as URI scheme handler | true           |
     | Protocol                       | "org-protocol" |

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘OrgProtocol’ app will be used
without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true

   If you’re using Emacs Mac Port
(https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport), it registered its
‘Emacs.app‘ as the default handler for the URL scheme ‘org-protocol‘.
To make ‘OrgProtocol.app’ the default handler instead, run:

     defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
     '{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = { "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";}'

   Then restart your computer.

11.3 The ‘roam-file’ protocol
=============================

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the ‘file’
key (e.g.  ‘org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org’).  This is used
in the generated graph.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: The roam-ref Protocol,  Prev: The roam-file protocol,  Up: Roam Protocol

11.4 The ‘roam-ref’ Protocol
============================

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given ‘ROAM_KEY’ (see
*note Anatomy of an Org-roam File::):

 [image src="images/roam-ref.gif" ]

   To use this, create a Firefox bookmarklet as follows:

     javascript:location.href =
     'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
     + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
     + '&title='
     + encodeURIComponent(document.title)

   or as a keybinding in ‘qutebrowser’, adding the following to the
‘autoconfig.yml’ file:

     settings:
       bindings.commands:
         global:
           normal:
             gc: open javascript:void(location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title))

   where ‘template’ is the template key for a template in
‘org-roam-capture-ref-templates’ (see *note The Templating System::).
These templates should contain a ‘#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}’ in it.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Diagnosing and Repairing Files,  Next: Appendix,  Prev: Roam Protocol,  Up: Top

12 Diagnosing and Repairing Files
*********************************

Org-roam provides a utility for diagnosing and repairing problematic
files via ‘org-roam-doctor’.  By default, ‘org-roam-doctor’ runs the
check across all Org-roam files, and this can take some time.  To run
the check only for the current file, run ‘C-u M-x org-roam-doctor’.

   • Function: org-roam-doctor &optional this-buffer

     Perform a check on Org-roam files to ensure cleanliness.  If
     THIS-BUFFER, run the check only for the current buffer.

   The checks run are defined in ‘org-roam-doctor--checkers’.  Each
checker is an instance of ‘org-roam-doctor-checker’.  To define a
checker, use ‘make-org-roam-doctor-checker’.  Here is a sample
definition:

     (make-org-roam-doctor-checker
         :name 'org-roam-doctor-broken-links
         :description "Fix broken links."
         :actions '(("d" . ("Unlink" . org-roam-doctor--remove-link))
                    ("r" . ("Replace link" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link))
                    ("R" . ("Replace link (keep label)" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link-keep-label))))

   The ‘:name’ property is the name of the function run.  The function
takes in the Org parse tree, and returns a list of ‘(point
error-message)’.  ‘:description’ is a short description of what the
checker does.  ‘:actions’ is an alist containing elements of the form
‘(char . (prompt . function))’.  These actions are defined per checker,
to perform autofixes for the errors.  For each error detected,
‘org-roam-doctor’ will move the point to the current error, and pop-up a
help window displaying the error message, as well as the list of actions
that can be taken provided in ‘:actions’.

13.2 Ecosystem
==============

A number of packages work well combined with Org-Roam:

* Menu:

* Deft::
* Org-journal::
* Note-taking Add-ons::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Deft,  Next: Org-journal,  Up: Ecosystem

13.2.1 Deft
-----------

Deft (https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) provides a nice interface for
browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

     (use-package deft
       :after org
       :bind
       ("C-c n d" . deft)
       :custom
       (deft-recursive t)
       (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
       (deft-default-extension "org")
       (deft-directory "/path/to/org-roam-files/"))

   If the title of the Org file is not the first line, you might not get
nice titles.  You may choose to patch this to use ‘org-roam’’s
functionality.  Here I’m using el-patch
(https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch):

     (use-package el-patch
       :straight (:host github
                        :repo "raxod502/el-patch"
                        :branch "develop"))

     (eval-when-compile
       (require 'el-patch))

     (use-package deft
       ;; same as above...
       :config/el-patch
       (defun deft-parse-title (file contents)
         "Parse the given FILE and CONTENTS and determine the title.
     If `deft-use-filename-as-title' is nil, the title is taken to
     be the first non-empty line of the FILE.  Else the base name of the FILE is
     used as title."
         (el-patch-swap (if deft-use-filename-as-title
                            (deft-base-filename file)
                          (let ((begin (string-match "^.+$" contents)))
                            (if begin
                                (funcall deft-parse-title-function
                                         (substring contents begin (match-end 0))))))
                        (org-roam--get-title-or-slug file))))

   The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get
huge.  Notdeft (https://github.com/hasu/notdeft) is a fork of Deft that
uses an external search engine and indexer.

13.2.2 Org-journal
------------------

Org-journal (https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) is a more powerful
alternative to the simple function ‘org-roam-dailies-today’.  It
provides better journaling capabilities, and a nice calendar interface
to see all dated entries.

     (use-package org-journal
       :bind
       ("C-c n j" . org-journal-new-entry)
       :custom
       (org-journal-date-prefix "#+TITLE: ")
       (org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
       (org-journal-dir "/path/to/org-roam-files/")

14.1 How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?
====================================================

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
‘org-roam-directory’ to be different in different directories.  It does
this by checking for a file named ‘.dir-locals.el’.

   To add support for multiple directories, override the
‘org-roam-directory’ variable using directory-local variables.  This is
what ‘.dir-locals.el’ may contain:

     ((nil . ((org-roam-directory . "/path/to/here/"))))

   All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate
set of Org-roam files.  Remember to run ‘org-roam-db-build-cache’ from a
file within that directory, at least once.
