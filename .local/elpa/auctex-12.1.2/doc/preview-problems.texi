A number of issues are known concerning the interoperation with various
other software. Some of the known problems can be solved by moving to
newer versions of the problematic software or by simple patches.

Some fonts have been reported to produce wrong characters with
@previewlatex{}.  @previewlatex{} calls Dvips by default with the option
@option{-Pwww} in order to get scalable fonts for nice results.  If you
are using antialiasing, however, the results might be sufficiently nice
with bitmapped fonts, anyway.  You might try @option{-Ppdf} for another
stab at scalable fonts, or other printer definitions.  Use

@display
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} preview-fast-dvips-command @key{RET}}
@end display
@noindent
and
@display
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} preview-dvips-command @key{RET}}
@end display
@noindent
in order to customize this.

One particular problem is that several printer setup files (typically in
a file called @file{/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.pdf} if you are
using the @option{-Ppdf} switch) contain the @option{G} option for
`character shifting'.  This option will result in @samp{fi} being
rendered as @samp{@pounds{}} (British Pounds sign) in several fonts,
unless your version of Dvips has a long-standing bug in its
implementation fixed (only very recent versions of Dvips have).

@node Too small bounding boxes
@section Too small bounding boxes
The bounding box of a preview is determined by the @LaTeX{} package
using the pure @TeX{} bounding boxes.  If there is material extending
outside of the @TeX{} box, that material will be missing from the
preview image.  This happens for the label-showing boxes from
the @code{showkeys} package.  This particular problem can be
circumvented by using the @code{showlabels} option of the preview
package.

In general, you should try to fix the problem in the @TeX{} code, like
avoiding drawing outside of the picture with PSTricks.

One possible remedy is to set
@code{preview-fast-conversion} to `Off' 
@ifset rawfile
(see the manual).
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
(@pxref{The Emacs interface}).
@end ifclear
The conversion will take more time, but will then use the bounding boxes
from @acronym{EPS} files generated by Dvips.

Dvips generally does not miss things, but it does not understand
PostScript constructs like @code{\resizebox} or @code{\rotate} commands,
so will generate rather wrong boxes for those.  Dvips can be helped with
the @code{psfixbb} package option to preview 
@ifset rawfile
(see the manual),
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
(@pxref{The LaTeX style file}),
@end ifclear
which will tag the corners of the included @TeX{} box.  This will mostly
be convenient for @emph{pure} PostScript stuff like that created by
PSTricks, which Dvips would otherwise reserve no space for.

@node x-symbol interoperation
@section x-symbol interoperation

Thanks to the work of Christoph Wedler, starting with version
@samp{4.0h/beta} of x-symbol, the line parsing of @AUCTeX{} and
@previewlatex{} is fully supported.  Earlier versions exhibit problems.
However, versions before 4.2.2 will cause a drastic slowdown of
@previewlatex{}'s parsing pass, so we don't recommend to use versions
earlier than that.

If you wonder what x-symbol is, it is a package that transforms various
tokens and subscripts to a more readable form while editing and offers a
few input methods handy especially for dealing with math. Take a look at
@uref{http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net}.

x-symbol versions up to 4.5.1-beta at least require an 8bit-clean @TeX{}
implementation (meaning that its terminal output should not use
@samp{^^}-started escape sequences) for cooperation with
@previewlatex{}.  Later versions may get along without it, like
@previewlatex{} does now.

If you experience problems with @file{circ.tex} in connection with both
x-symbol and Latin-1 characters, you may need to change your language
environment or, as a last resort, customize the variable
@code{LaTeX-command-style} by replacing the command @code{latex} with
@code{latex -translate-file=cp8bit}.

@node Middle-clicks paste instead of toggling
@section Middle-clicks paste instead of toggling

This is probably the fault of your favorite package.  @file{isearch.el}
is known to be affected while searches are in progress, but the code is
such a complicated mess that no patch is in sight.  Better just end the
search with @kbd{@key{RET}} before toggling and resume with @kbd{C-s
C-s} or similar afterwards.  Since previews over the current match will
auto-open, anyway, this should not be much of a problem in practice.
