Magithub is a Magit-based interface to GitHub.

Integrated into Magit workflows, Magithub lets you interact with
your GitHub repositories and manage your work/play from emacs:

 - push brand-new local repositories up to GitHub
 - create forks of existing repositories
 - submit pull requests upstream
 - view and create issues
 - view, create, and edit comments
 - view status checks (e.g., Travis CI)
 - manage labels and assignees
 - view/visit notifications
 - write personal notes on issues for reference later
 - and probably more...

Press `H' in the status buffer to get started -- happy hacking!
