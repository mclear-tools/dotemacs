;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple benchmark of calls to Emacs require and load functions.
;; It can be used to keep track of where time is being spent during Emacs
;; startup in order to optimize startup times.
;; The code is based on init-benchmarking.el by Steve Purcell.

;;; Installation:

;; Place this file in your load path and add the following code to the
;; beginning of your Emacs initialization script:

;; (require 'benchmark-init)

;; Data collection will begin as soon as benchmark-init has been loaded.

;;; Usage:

;; After Emacs has finished loading the following functions will bring up
;; the results:
;;
;;  - `benchmark-init/show-durations-tabulated'
;;  - `benchmark-init/show-durations-tree'
;;
;; Data collection can be controlled using the following two functions:
;;
;;  - `benchmark-init/activate'
;;  - `benchmark-init/deactivate'

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
