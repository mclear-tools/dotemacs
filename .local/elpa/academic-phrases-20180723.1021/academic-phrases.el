;;; Commentary:

;; When writing your academic paper, you might get stuck trying to find the
;; right phrase that captures your intention. This package tries to alleviate
;; that problem by presenting you with a list of phrases organized by the topic
;; or by the paper section that you are writing. This package has around 600
;; phrases so far.

;; Using this package is easy, just call `M-x academic-phrases` to
;; get a list of phrases organized by topic, or call
;; `academic-phrases-by-section` to browse the phrases by the paper
;; section and fill-in the blanks if required.

;; This work was based on the freely available PDF titled "English
;; for Writing Research - Papers Useful Phrases" which can be found
;; here <https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319260921>. This work
;; was done with the kind permission of Springer Nature and Adrian
