If you are working with XML documents, the parsed data structure
returned by the XML parser (xml.el) may be enough for you: Lists of
lists, symbols, strings, plus a number of accessor functions.

If you want a more elaborate data structure to work with your XML
document, you can create a document object model (DOM) from the XML
data structure using doom.el.

You can create a DOM from XML using `doom-make-document-from-xml'
with the input from `libxml-parse-xml-region'. See function documentation
below for an example

This library is called doom instead of dom because Emacs now comes
with its own library called dom which does something slightly
different.

On Interfaces and Classes

The elisp DOM implementation uses the doom-node structure to store all
attributes.  The various interfaces consist of sets of functions to
manipulate these doom-nodes.  The functions of a certain interface
share the same prefix.
