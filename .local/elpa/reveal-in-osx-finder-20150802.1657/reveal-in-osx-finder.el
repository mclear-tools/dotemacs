;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; If M-x reveal-in-osx-finder is invoked in a file-associated buffer,
;; it will open the folder enclosing the file in the OS X Finder.
;; It will also highlight the file the buffer is associated with within the folder.
;;
;; If M-x reveal-in-osx-finder is invoked in a dired buffer,
;; it will open the current folder in the OS X Finder.
;; It will also highlight the file at point if available.
;;
;; If M-x reveal-in-osx-finder is invoked in a buffer not associated with a file,
;; it will open the folder defined in the default-directory variable.
