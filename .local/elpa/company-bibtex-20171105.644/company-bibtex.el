;;; Commentary:
;;; `company-bibtex' provides a backend for the
;;; company-mode framework, enabling completion of bibtex keys in
;;; modes used for prose writing.  This backend activates for citation
;;; styles used by `pandoc-mode' (@), `latex-mode' (\cite{}), and
;;; `org-mode' (ebib:).
;;;
;;; Load the package and add it to the company-backends:
;;;
;;;  (require 'company-bibtex)
;;;  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-bibtex)
;;;
;;; `company-bibtex' reads from a bibliography file or files
;;; specified in `company-bibtex-bibliography'.  For example:
;;;
;;;   (setq company-bibtex-bibliography
;;;    '("/home/cooluser/thesis/thesis1.bib"
;;;      "/home/cooluser/thesis/thesi2.bib"))
;;;
;;; The regular expression matching key names alphanumeric characters,
;;; dashes (-), and underscores (_).  This is customizable via
;;; `company-bibtex-key-regex'.  For example:
;;;
;;;  (setq company-bibtex-key-regex "[[:alnum:]+_]*")
;;;
