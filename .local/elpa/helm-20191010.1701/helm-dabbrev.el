The idea is to compute candidates while cycling the first ones, so
this is available only if `helm-dabbrev-cycle-threshold' is not 0 or
nil, also it is available only on emacs-26+ (needs threads).

This is reasonably working when you don't have to complete a huge list
of candidates, otherwise you will have a small delay after the first cycle
because thread is released unexpectedly when helm-dabbrev exit after
first insertion.

IOW keep `helm-dabbrev-candidates-number-limit' to a reasonable
value (I don't!) and give enough prefix before completing e.g. for
completing \"helm-dabbrev\" use \"helm-d\" and not \"he\" if you want
to use this."
