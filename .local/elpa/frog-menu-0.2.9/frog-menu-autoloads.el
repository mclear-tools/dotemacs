Read a command from CMDS and execute it.

CMDS is a list of command symbols to choose from.  If PROMPT is
given it should be a string with prompt information for the
user.

\(fn CMDS &optional PROMPT)" nil nil)

(autoload 'frog-menu-read "frog-menu" "\
Read from a menu of variable `frog-menu-type'.

PROMPT is a string with prompt information for the user.

COLLECTION is a list from which the user can choose an item. It
can be a list of strings or an alist mapping strings to return
values. Users can switch to `completing-read' from COLLECTION
using the TAB key. For sorting the displayed strings see
`frog-menu-sort-function'.

ACTIONS is an additional list of actions that can be given to let
the user choose an action instead an item from COLLECTION.

Each ACTION is a list of the form:

    (KEY DESCRIPTION RETURN)

Where KEY is a string to be interpreted as spelled-out
keystrokes, using the same format as for `kbd'.

DESCRIPTION is a string to be displayed along with KEY to
describe the action.

RETURN will be the returned value if KEY is pressed.

\(fn PROMPT COLLECTION &optional ACTIONS)" nil nil)
