This is a minor mode that can be enabled from a dired buffer.
Once enabled it will show the file from point in the other window.
Moving to the other file within the dired buffer with <down>/<up> or
C-n/C-p will display different file.
Hitting <SPC> will scroll the peeped file down, whereas
C-<SPC> and <backspace> will scroll it up.
