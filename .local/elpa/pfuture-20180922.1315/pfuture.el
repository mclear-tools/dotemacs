  "Pfuture variant that supports a callback-based workflow.
Internally based on `make-process'. Requires lexical scope.

The first - and only required - argument is COMMAND. It is an (unquoted) list of
the command and the arguments for the process that should be started. A vector
is likewise acceptable - the difference is purely cosmetic.

The rest of the argument list is made up of the following keyword arguments:

ON-SUCCESS is the code that will run once the process has finished with an exit
code of 0. In its context, these variables are bound:
`process': The process object, as passed to the sentinel callback function.
`status': The string exit status, as passed to the sentinel callback function.
`pfuture-buffer': The buffer where the output of the process is collected,
 including both stdin and stdout. You can use `pfuture-output-from-buffer' to
 quickly grab the buffer's content.

ON-SUCCESS may take one of 3 forms: an unquoted sexp, a quoted function or an
unquoted function. In the former two cases the passed fuction will be called
with `process', `status' and `buffer' as its arguments.

ON-FAILURE is the inverse to ON-SUCCESS; it will only run if the process has
finished with a non-zero exit code. Otherwise the same conditions apply as for
ON-SUCCESS.

ON-STATUS-CHANGE will run on every status change, even if the process remains
running. It is meant for debugging and has access to the same variables as
ON-SUCCESS and ON-ERROR, including the (potentially incomplete) process output
buffer. Otherwise the same conditions as for ON-SUCCESS and ON-ERROR apply.

DIRECTORY is the value given to `default-directory' for the context of the
process. If not given it will fall back the current value of `default-directory'.

NAME will be passed to the :name property of `make-process'. If not given it will
fall back to \"Pfuture Callback [$COMMAND]\".

CONNECTION-TYPE will be passed to the :connection-process property of
`make-process'. If not given it will fall back to 'pipe.

BUFFER is the buffer that will be used by the process to collect its output.
Providing a buffer outside of specific use-cases is not necessary, as by default
pfuture will assign every launched command its own unique buffer and kill it
after ON-SUCCESS or ON-ERROR have finished running. However, no such cleanup
will take place if a custom buffer is provided.

FILTER is a process filter-function (quoted function reference) that can be used
to overwrite pfuture's own filter. By default pfuture uses its filter function
to collect the launched process' output in its buffer, thus when providing a
custom filter output needs to be gathered another way. Note that the process'
buffer is stored in its `buffer' property and is therefore accessible via
\(process-get process 'buffer\)."
