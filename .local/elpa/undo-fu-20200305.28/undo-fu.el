;;; Commentary:

;; Undo/redo convenience wrappers to Emacs default undo commands.
;;
;; The redo operation can be accessed from a key binding
;; and stops redoing once the initial undo action is reached.
;;
;; If you want to cross the initial undo boundary to access
;; the full history, running [keyboard-quit] (typically C-g).
;; lets you continue redoing for functionality not typically
;; accessible with regular undo/redo.
;;

;;; Usage

;; ;; Bind the keys
;; (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-z")   'undo-fu-only-undo)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'undo-fu-only-redo)
