*UPDATE 2017-01-24*: Now use `avy' instead of `ace-jump-mode'.

Jump to and correct spelling errors using `avy' and flyspell. Inspired
by [abo-abo(Oleh Krehel)]'s [ace-link].

1 Setup
=======

  ,----
  | (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-flyspell")
  | (require 'ace-flyspell)
  `----

  Optional:
  ,----
  | M-x ace-flyspell-setup
  `----

  If you call `M-x ace-flyspell-setup' , then this setup binds the
  command `ace-flyspell-dwim' to C-., which is originally bound to
  `flyspell-auto-correct-word' if you enable the `flyspell-mode'. Of
  course, you can choose to change the key binding.

  Usually, you should enable `flyspell-mode' because this package aims
  to jump to and correct spelling errors detected by `flyspell', or at
  least you need to run `flyspell-buffer' to detect spelling errors.


2 Usage
=======

  There are three available commands:


2.1 `ace-flyspell-jump-word'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This command jumps to an spelling error using `avy', and move the
  point to where the spelling error is.

  The following demo shows the usage of `ace-flyspell-jump-word':
  [./screencasts/ace-flyspell-jump-word.gif]

  If you prefer this command to the following `ace-flyspell-dwim' (which
  will be bound to C-. if you call `M-x ace-flyspell-setup'), you should
  probably give it a key binding.


2.2 `ace-flyspell-correct-word'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This command is different from `ace-flyspell-jump-word' in the sense
  that it aims to *correct* rather than *jump to* the spelling error. At
  first, it looks like `ace-flyspell-jump-word', but after you jump to
  the misspelt word, it will enter another /mode/, where you hit . to
  invoke `flyspell-auto-correct-word' to correct the current misspelt
  word and hit any other key to accept the correction and return to the
  original position. You can also hit , to save the current word into
  personal dictionary.

  This command is useful when you're writing an article and want to
  temporarily go back to some spelling error and return to where you
  left off after fixing the error.


2.3 `ace-flyspell-dwim'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If the word under the cursor is misspelt, then this command is
  identical to `flyspell-auto-correct-word', otherwise it will call
  `ace-flyspell-correct-word' to jump to and correct some spelling
  error.

  This command is bound to C-. after you call `M-x ace-flyspell-setup'.

  The following demo shows the usage of `ace-flyspell-dwim' (Since there
  is no misspelt word at the cursor, `ace-flyspell-dwim' actually
  performs the same thing as `ace-flyspell-correct-word' does):
