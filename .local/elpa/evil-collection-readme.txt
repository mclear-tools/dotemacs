A set of keybindings for Evil mode.

If you want to use Evil in the minibuffer, you'll have to enable it by
setting `evil-collection-setup-minibuffer' to t before loading this package.
This is so because many users find it confusing.
Some minibuffer-related packages such as Helm rely on this option.
