;;; ox-hugo-auto-export.el --- Auto export using ox-hugo -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Authors: Kaushal Modi <kaushal.mod@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://ox-hugo.scripter.co

;;; Commentary:

;; *This is NOT a stand-alone package.*
;;
;; It calls `org-hugo-export-wim-to-md' which auto-loads ox-hugo.
;;
;; What this file does when `require'd:
;; - Sets `org-hugo-auto-export-on-save' as safe if boolean.
;; - Updates `org-hugo--org-capture-active-flag'
;;   in `org-capture-before-finalize-hook' and
;;   `org-capture-after-finalize-hook' hooks.
;; - Adds `org-hugo-auto-export-hook-fn' to `org-mode-hook'.

;;; Usage:
;; With `ox-hugo' installed,
;;
;; 1. Add below to your Emacs config:
;;
;;      (require 'ox-hugo-auto-export)
;;
;;    ** Do NOT autoload any function from this package
;;       -- Just `require' it as shown above. **
;;
;; 2. Add below to your project's .dir-locals.el file (assuming that
;;    the Org files in the "content-org" directory are meant to be
;;    auto-exported using `ox-hugo':
;;
;;      (("content-org"
;;        . ((org-mode . ((org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . t))))))
;;

;;; Code:

(defvar-local org-hugo-auto-export-on-save nil
  "Enable flag for `org-hugo-export-wim-to-md-after-save'.

This is a buffer local variable to enable auto-exporting using
`ox-hugo' on file saving.  It is intended to be set in
.dir-locals.el files.

For example, put the below in your project's .dir-locals.el if
the Org files in the \"content-org\" directory are meant to be
auto-exported using `ox-hugo':

\((\"content-org\"
  . ((org-mode . ((org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . t)))))) ")
;; Declare this variable as safe if its value is boolean (t or nil),
;; so that adding it to .dir-locals.el does not prompt users.
