;;; Commentary:
;; Workspaces leveraging tab-bar and project.el. A "workspace" is just a tab
;; with an isolated set of buffers (see consult function). ùõå-Emacs sets things
;; up so that these workspaces are nicely displayed out of the way in the echo
;; area rather than as visible tabs in the header tab-line at the top of the
;; frame.
