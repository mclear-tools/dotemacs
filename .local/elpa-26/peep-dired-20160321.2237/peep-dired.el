;;; Commentary:

;; This is a minor mode that can be enabled from a dired buffer.
;; Once enabled it will show the file from point in the other window.
;; Moving to the other file within the dired buffer with <down>/<up> or
;; C-n/C-p will display different file.
;; Hitting <SPC> will scroll the peeped file down, whereas
;; C-<SPC> and <backspace> will scroll it up.
