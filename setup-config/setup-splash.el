;; This file defines the splash screen
;;  - No logo, no modeline, no scrollbars
;;  - Any key / mouse click kills the splash screen
;;  - With emacs-mac (Mituharu), splash screen is faded out after .5 seconds
;;
;; Note: The screen is not shown if there are opened file buffers. For
;;       example, if you start emacs with a filename on the command
;;       line, the splash screen is not shown.
;;
;; Usage:
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'cl-lib)
